# Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance

### Purpose
The purpose of our work is to analyze a handful of Green Energy stock to determine which stocks would be most profitable for investment.

### Updated Workbook

### Folder with PNG's of some of the pop-ups with script run time


# Written Analysis of Results

## Overview of Project
Our client Steve, just graduated with a finance degree from college.  His parents are his first clients.  They want to invest their money in DAQO New Energy Corp (makes silicon wafers for solar panels), but have not done their research on whether or not this is the 'best' Green Energy in which to invest.  Steve, on the other hand has done his research on several Green Energy companies and their profitability.  He has asked for an analysis of his research that shows return on investments for the years 2017 and 2018 for a handful of Green Energy Stocks.  The analysis tool used will be Visual Basic Application (VBA).

## Results
The comparison of stock performance between years 2017 and 2018, favor 2017 in that there was more growth in the selected stocks.

## Summary
The comparison of stock performance between years 2017 and 2018, favor 2017 in that there was more growth in the selected stocks.
Advantages of refactoring code are that it makes it more easily read, increases efficiency which allows for 'bugs' to be removed.  A disadvantage of refactoring is that it is time consuming and goes against tight deadlines. When code is refactored, the functionality of the code is improved and made more simple.  To do this, however, consider how much time is available and what the expected outcome should be.  When code is refactored, bugs can also be introduced to a once bug free code.
